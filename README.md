For Game nights, when duck tape is out, you can open this game via browser on your phone, hit new and it will assign you a random person (or animal or number). Source is an array and for loop between -500 and 500. So 3000 Options.

Then each player can place the phone in front of you and the player to the left can push the new button, so the game can start (till phone battery dies).
